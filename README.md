`pkm-server` is the utility used to host package repositories for Windows 96. You can use a regular http server if you want, but this is the preffered and official method, since it includes some extras.

## How to install

1. Clone the repository.

2. Get NodeJS from https://nodejs.org


3. Run `npm install` in the cloned directory.

## How to run

Run `bin/pkmsd` to start the server.

If those scripts don't work for whatever reason, you can also simply execute `node index.js` inside the repo dir.
