`Release.json` is a file located at the root of each repository.
Its intent is to describe the repository briefly.

It contains the following fields:
    name -> The friendly name of the repository
    maintainers -> A list of maintainers which maintain this repository.
                    Maintainers should be separated like so:
                        Maintainer1 <Email or contact> | Maintainer2 <Email or contact>
    id -> The ID to assign this repository

Here is an example one you can use (if the example Release.json doesn't exist for some reason):

{
    "name": "My Repository",
    "maintainers": "Some User <some_user@example.com>",
    "id": "main"
}
