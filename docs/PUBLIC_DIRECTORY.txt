`public/` is the root of your Windows 96 packages repository.

Users should be able to specify a channel. `main` is the default channel.

The URL format for repositories is like so:
    https://mywebsite.com/CHANNEL

In the case of the main channel, it would be
    https://mywebsite.com/main

Channels don't need to be put at the root.
    https://mywebsite.com/packages/main

    is also a perfectly valid URL for PackMan to use.

Channels could also be referred to as sub-repositories, since they're basically just a framework for multiple repositories on one host.
